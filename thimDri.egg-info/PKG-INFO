        The TIHM project embraces the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) approach inorder to improve the health and wellbeing of people with dementia and their carers. Dementia is a serious disorder, with over 850,000 affected in the UK (Prince et al 2013, 2014), costing £23bn annually (Luengo-Fernandez et al, 2010). The research is funded by NHS England and Innovate UK as one of only two IoT ‘Test Bed’ sites.
